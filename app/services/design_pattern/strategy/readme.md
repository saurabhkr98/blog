In Ruby, the Strategy Design Pattern is used to define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each algorithm, and make them interchangeable. 
This pattern allows a client to choose an algorithm at runtime without tightly coupling the client to the implementation details of the algorithm. 

In this example:

- We define different payment strategies (CreditCardPayment, PaypalPayment) that inherit from PaymentStrategy.
- Each payment strategy implements the pay method, which encapsulates the specific payment logic.
- The PaymentProcessor class takes a payment strategy during initialization and uses it to process payments via the process_payment method.
- We can switch between different payment strategies dynamically by setting a new payment strategy for the PaymentProcessor.

Conclusion:
The Strategy Design Pattern in Ruby allows us to encapsulate interchangeable behaviors (payment methods in this case) 
into separate classes, making the system more flexible and easier to maintain. This pattern promotes loose coupling between the 
client code and the specific implementations of algorithms, enabling runtime selection of strategies based on requirements.


The Strategy design pattern is categorized as a behavioral design pattern.
